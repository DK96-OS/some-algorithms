## Some Algorithms
This repository is dedicated to the development and comparison of similar algorithms.
An algorithm can be tested on various data inputs, and compared with variants of the algorithm.

### Max Distance Algorithm
__Definition:__
The Max Distance is the largest distance between two equal integer values in an array.

The Initial Algorithm was developed by applying the brute force and greedy algorithm techniques.
Further optimizations of the algorithm involve applying logical constraints to eliminate unnecessary work.
